The below is a live representation of every job available on the www.jobs.ca.gov website.  
Using the results from this kimono API we can feed another kimono API to pull a feed of every individual posting
<br><br>
This results in a json-ified version of the website, which we can use to populate a web database for serving content
Current DB systems being investigated for implementation: mongoDB, postgreSQL, mySQL, Redis
<br><br>
Loading of content may take approximately 10 seconds, due to results numbering 850-950 sets.  This kimono block is meant for demonstration purposes and does not scale nicely; kimono blocks would not be used in live production
